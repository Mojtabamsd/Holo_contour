Welcome to holocontour's documentation!
=======================================

**Holocontour** is a small but capable toolkit that turns raw in‑line digital holograms into clean binary masks of planktonic particles.
It couples intensity‑driven region growing with a contour‑refinement step, and wraps everything in a reproducible, YAML‑configurable pipeline built on top of `MorphoCut <https://github.com/morphocut/morphocut>`_.
Outputs ship in an archive ready for direct upload to `EcoTaxa <https://ecotaxa.obs-vlfr.fr/>`_.
